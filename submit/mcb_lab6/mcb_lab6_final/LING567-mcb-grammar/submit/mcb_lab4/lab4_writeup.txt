#PHENOMENA: 
	1.adnominal possession
	2.wh questions
	3.clausal modifiers

For this week, the customization system is down, so we chose to focus on the three phenomena that we picked only. We will go back to the testing on tsdb next week. 
We also take a brief look into the ace thing, but we haven't drawn any detailed conclusion yet.

# ADNOMINAL POSSESSION
##################################################

The first phenomena we pick this week is adnominal possession. It is interesting to see that there are two possessive patterns for Matsigenka. Basically, Matsigenka nouns can be split into two categories, the alienable nouns and inalienable nouns. Inalienable nouns stand for words like kin terms, body parts and a small amount of manufactured objects, while alienable nouns are things like commodities. 
Inalienable nouns have to appear with possessive prefixes as a noun phrase, like ‘my nose’ and ‘her brother.’ For alienable nouns, the possession is marked by three different suffixes distinguished by the prosodic factors. 
	disyllabic nominal roots take -ne,
	trisyllabic or larger roots take -te,
	some specific manufactured object nouns take -re.
Therefore, we created 5 pairs of sentences that can test the grammar. The negative sentences have problems like missing the possessive prefix, missing the possessive suffix, adding an extra alienable possessive suffix to an inalienable noun, and using wrong possessive suffix. 

The following is a pair of example sentences for adnominal possession.

# WH-QUESTIONS
##################################################


The second phenomena we pick is wh-questions:
Wh-questions in Matsigenka is similar to the interrogation patterns in English. The interrogation pronoun is put in the sentence initial position. The common interrogate gloss is presented below.
interrogative         gloss
tata                      `what'
tsini                `who, whom'
tyani        `which one (animate)'
tyati        `which one (inanimate)'
tya(ra)             `where', `how'
While the subject or the object is the questioning target, we usually omit the subject/object marker. To test this feature, we created 4 sentences that are related to the word ‘who.’ However, we cannot find an interrogative ‘who’ in our corpus. Therefore, examples 11 to 14 are sort of useless at some point. 
When a peripheral argument (neither object nor subject) is being interrogated, neither subject marker nor object marker would be omitted. 
Also, the word ‘why’ in Matsigenka cannot be presented as a single word, but a word ‘where/how’ plus a light verb ‘happen’. 
The following is a pair of example sentences for wh questions,

# CLAUSAL MODIFIERS
##################################################

For clausal modifiers, there was a lot of information in the resource text from "Nanti Evidential Practice" (Lev Michael 2008).

Different forms covered were:
- deranked and ranked relative clauses
- non-specific relative clause constructions (using interrogative pronouns like "whoever", "whatever", etc.)
- verbal complement clauses (attached to verbs of communication, cognition, perception, etc.)
- possible conditionals and epistemic conditionals
- counterfactual conditionals
- temporal succession, brief temporal/spatial overlap, prolonged temporal overlap, temporal anteriority/posteriority
- purposive clauses
- cause/effect clauses
- contrastive constructions such as frustrative clauses and "on the contrary"/"however"

The text described in great detail differences between the forms wrt:
- morphology
	+ surface string
	+ position relative to verb
	+ free element vs affix
- realis/irrealis requirements on main clause vs subordinate clause
- order of main clause vs subordinate clause
- restrictions on subjects of two clauses (coreferential vs not)
- positive and negative polarity clause behavior

Unfortunately, when it came to looking at our corpus and making testsuite sentences, it seemed to be the case that between Nanti and Matsigenka, there is actually bit of difference in specificity of behavior. In particular, it seemed that much of the distinction outlined in the text in markers for different types of clauses (for example, the perfective and imperfective suffixes "-ankicha" and "-tsi" for deranked relative clauses in Nanti) seemed to be almost entirely covered by the subordinating marker "=ra" (which seems to be by and large the most common clausal marker present in most complex sentences). Though it is possible some of the lack of evidence for several types of markers is due to our limited corpus, the same behavior is seen in "Matsigenka Texts written by Matsigenka Authors" (Lev Michael 2013), with the forms also notably missing from the Glossing Conventions sections of the same document.

Therefore, after a careful study of the corpus, we've narrowed down our current test suite to cover the clausal behaviors for:
- temporal/spatial overlap
- VP complements
- causative behavior
- conditionals
We've constructed several sentences to test each of these behaviors, but as almost all of these sentences have been constructed by us and compiled from a combination of Nanti grammar rules, we'd like to make a caveat that we'll be checking our grammar claims and grammaticality judgments we've made with our linguist over the coming week.

**************************************************
Temporal/Spatial Overlap

As mentioned, Matsigenka uses the suffix "=ra" to mark a subordinate clause, which is used extensively through the grammar. In general, the language does not explicitly spell out relationships between clauses, which are left to the observer to deduce. However, it seems that the "=ra" in the absence of other markers and with compatible reality status markings should be able to imply a general air of events happening concurrently (with direct causality either marked with more specific markers or up to judgment).

A few characteristics of "=ra" clauses indicating temporal/spatial overlap:
- there is no restriction on the subjects of the two clauses, which can be coreferential or not
- the reality status of the subordinate clause should match that of the main clause
- though the Nanti grammar states a tendency for the main clause to appear first, we have not observed a strong bias in this respect

Therefore, some examples of sentences showing this clause structure:

	i-matik-ak-i i-ogonke-t-ak-a=ra
	3mS-sing-PERF-realis 3mS-arrive-EPC-PERF-realis.refl=SUB
	He sang when he arrived

	i-ogonke-t-ak-a=ra i-matik-ak-i
	3mS-arrive-EPC-PERF-realis.refl=SUB 3mS-sing-PERF-realis
	When he arrived, he sang

The following sentence would be ungrammatical due to the mismatch in reality status:

	i-matik-ak-i i-n-ogonke-t-ak-enpa=ra
	3mS-sing-PERF-realis 3mS-irrealis-arrive-EPC-PERF-irrealis.refl=SUB
	He sang when he arrives

**************************************************
VP Complements

Certain verbs allow for clausal complements (to see, to hear, to finish, to know, etc.). The marking of the clausal complement verb with the "=ra" marker seems to be optional in some verbs like "see", though there may be some more subtle meaning difference that we will need to ask the linguist about. The Nanti grammar text also suggests that factors like coreferentiality of subjects and reality status vary from verb to verb, but one thing that is a requirement is that the complement clause is postverbal.

Here are just two sentences illustrating the verbs "see" and "hear":

	i-ne-i i-ar-apa-ak-i tsinaro
	3mS-see-realis 3mS-fly-ALL-PERF-realis grasshopper
	He sees a grasshopper flying

	i-kem-i=ro o-kant-ak-i
	3mS-hear-realis=3fO 3fS-say-PERF-realis
	he heard her say

**************************************************
Causative Behavior

Causative behavior is covered in the Nanti grammar text as a verb "kant" marking why an action occurred, "-ant" as an instrumental applicative," "irota" as an interclausal anaphoric element, and "irobenti" as causal marker that can be used similarly to "consequently" in a later sentence. However, none of this seems present in the Matsigenka text or corpus.

Inexplicably, there are two constructions that seem to be very prevalent in the Matsigenka text and corpus that seem to imply causative behavior yet are nowhere to be found in the Nanti grammar description:
- "ovashi", which means something akin to "so then" and can be found at the beginning of a clause (the clause can be either first or second in a clausal pair, and its "=ra" subordinator marking usage seems inconsistent).
- "=tari", which means something akin to "because" and is usually glossed as =REAS.
These two forms have been used in the same sentence, but it is unclear whether they can be used in the same clause (we've opted for no but will need to check with our linguist).

Some example sentences:

	ovashi i-noshik-ak-i=ro=ra potsoti i-kant-ak-i=ri=ra : 
	so 3mS-pull-PERF-realis=3fO=SUB achiote 3mS-say-PERF-realis=3mO=SUB : 
	So he pulled out the achiote and said to him: 

	i-noshik-ak-i=ro potsoti, ovashi i-kant-ak-i=ri : 
	3mS-pull-PERF-realis=3fO achiote, so 3mS-say-PERF-realis=3mO : 
	He pulled out the achiote, then he said to him: 

	i-noshik-ak-i=ro=tari potsoti i-kant-ak-i=ri : 
	3mS-pull-PERF-realis=3fO=REAS achiote 3mS-say-PERF-realis=3mO : 
	Because he pulled out the achiote, he said to him: 

An example sentence we've deemed ungrammatical but are unsure about:

	ovashi i-noshik-ak-i=ro=tari potsoti i-kant-ak-i=ri : 
	so 3mS-pull-PERF-realis=3fO=REAS achiote 3mS-say-PERF-realis=3mO : 
	So because he pulled out the achiote and said to him: 

**************************************************
Conditionals

The Nanti grammar text covers conditionals with some detail, and Nanti seems to use the same conditional marker as Matsigenka, "=rika".

The text makes a distinction between two types of conditions, in which positive and negative polarity is further distinguished:
- possible conditional = hypothetical or future conditions
	positive polarity condition clauses irrealis-marked
	negative polarity condition clauses take ha irrealis negator + =rika to form harika (doubly irrealis marked)
	positive polarity result clauses irrealis-marked
	negative polarity result clauses take hara irrealis negator
- epistemic conditional = conclusive past conditions (successful/failed) about which speaker is ignorant/uncertain
	positive polarity condition clauses realis-marked
	negative polarity condition clauses take te realis negator + =rika to form terika (singly irrealis marked)
	reality status of result clauses depends on its temporal reference and polarity

In our test examples we have only covered positive polarity sentences, as we have not covered the phenomenon of negation so far.

Example sentences for these two forms of conditions are:
- possible conditional:
	o-n-ne-ak-e=ri=rika o-n-kaem-ak-e 
	3fS-irrealis-see-PERF-irrealis=3mO=INDEF.TEMP 3fS-irrealis-call.out-PERF-irrealis
	if she sees him, she will cry out 
- epistemic conditional:
	o-ne-ak-i=ri=rika o-kaem-ak-i 
	3fS-see-PERF-realis=3mO=INDEF.TEMP 3fS-call.out-PERF-realis
	if she saw him, she cried out

**************************************************
Other clausal phenomena TBD

Here are a few other constructions we've observed in our corpus but have not constructed test suites for:
- quoting forms
- interrogative pronouns such as "tya-ni=rika" (whoever)
- frustrative with "-ve"
- simple succession with "inpo"
- contrary status with "arionpa"
