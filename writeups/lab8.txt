#LAB 8 write-up
#NAME: Hanshu Ding, Ling Tu
#LANGUAGE: mcb
##########################################################################################


1. A description of how the phenomenon you picked to work on is expressed in your language, including IGT.

2. A description of your implementation of this phenomenon, including:
	-A prose description of the analysis you implemented
	-The specific tdl you added/changed (paste it into the file)
	-IGT I can use to test the analysis
	-Any questions you have/things you want me to look into.

3. A description of any clean up work you did to get generation down to a reasonable number of outputs, including:
	-Which MMT items you worked on in this way
	-What the sources of extra generation output were
	-What changes you made to grammar (described in prose and illustrated with tdl)
	-Before/after numbers on how many outputs you're getting

4. A description of the status of each MMT item, with sje as source and with eng as source. Possible statuses:
	-Works! (But document how many outputs you get)
	-Doesn't work, because your language string doesn't parse and/or isn't available.
	-Doesn't work, because MRSes are different. Indicate how they differ.
	-Doesn't work, MRSes look the same, not sure what's going on.
	-A description of the performance of your final grammar for this week on the test suite and test corpus, as compared to your starting grammar (see details above).



02.23:----------
1. Pick one more phenomenon: wh questions/negation
     - Read the resources
     - Post it on canvas
     - Make testsuite
2. Go over the whole lab process, distribute some assignment
     - generation output ambiguity clean up:
	^ Free word order (expected).
	^ Gender ambiguity in dog/cat (we didn't specify gender yet on animals but we can fix this, as they are masculine).
	^ Locative marker firing optionally on all nouns (see Question #1).
	^ Object markers firing optionally on "nti" NP copula verb (see Question #2).

--------------------------------------------------
Translations remapping:
Cat = jaguar (matsontsori)
Dog = spider monkey (osheto)
Park = forest (inkenishi)
Car = canoe (*pito)


Existing relations:
- sleep (mag) - GLOSS: sleep
- eat (seka) - GLOSS: eat
- follow (ogia) - GLOSS: follow
- hungry (taseg) - GLOSS: be.hungry

Remapped relations:
- cat -> jaguar (matsontsori) - GLOSS: jaguar								-> _jaguar_n_rel
- dog -> spider monkey (osheto) - GLOSS: spider.monkey						-> _dog_n_rel
- car -> canoe (*pito) - GLOSS: canoe (always appears as canoe-ALIEN) 		-> _car_n_rel
- park -> forest (inkenishi) - GLOSS: forest (always appears as forest=LOC)	-> _park_n_rel
- ask -> tell (kamant) - GLOSS: tell -> _tell_v_rel

Adding to lexicon:
- canoe (*pito) - This was in sentences 1350 and 1790, but not in our lexicon; guessing with very low probability those two sentences both just happened to be in the set held out from training?
- to be hungry (taseg) - This was in our resource grammar "Matsigenka Texts Written By Matsigenka Authors" (2013, Pereira and Pereira)

WH- QUESTIONS IMPLEMENTATION:

Choices file:
Added output of wh- questions from grammar matrix
	tata, tya-ni, tya=ra

Tdl cleanup:
- Force wh-pronoun-noun-lex to require [CASE nlc] (non-locative) inputs instead (so that it doesn't accept PPs as inputs) 
	mcb.tdl: ---------------
		wh-pronoun-noun-lex := ... &
		  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD noun & [ CASE nlc ], ... ] ] ] ].
- Replace verb_trans_compclause-verb-lex with two rules, one for propositions and one for questions, and recategorize compclause verbs to be either prop or ques
	mcb.tdl: ---------------
		verb_trans_compclause-prop-verb-lex := clausal-nom-verb-lex & clausal-second-arg-trans-lex-item &
		  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL.CAT.VAL.COMPS < [ LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD verb &

GRAMMAR UPDATES: 
[ TO DO: which MMT items we worked with, before and after numbers ]

--------------------------------
Lexical cleanup (reducing verb choice ambiguity, unifying MRS relations, adding missing words):
- Comment out second meaning of verb "og" ("eat") and dump all additional meanings of "og" into the commented out lexical entry for now
	og_1 := verb_trans-verb-lex &
	  [ STEM < "og" >,
	    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_eat_v_rel" ].
	; og_2 := verb_trans-verb-lex &
	;   [ STEM < "og" >,
	;     SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_do.until-or-put_v_rel" ].
- Cleaned up lexical entry for "ne", which can mean "see" in the perceptual sense or "see/think" in the cognitive sense for mmt purpose
	ne_2 := verb_trans_compclause-prop-verb-lex &
	  [ STEM < "ne" >,
	    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_think_v_rel" ].
- Changed "ogio" predication "_follow_v_rel" to "_chase_v_rel" for mmt purpose
- Added lexical entry for "ask", which was not in our corpus but was in Matsigenka texts. Made it a compclause for now to get it to parse, not sure if this is right or not:
	kogako := verb_trans_compclause-verb-lex &
	  [ STEM < "kogako" >,
	    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_ask_v_rel" ].
- Changed lexical entry for "*pito" to "*pito-tsi" to simplify the "alienable" noun situation for now (and comment out the -tsi suffix lexical rule in our mmt grammar)
	*pito-tsi := noun_vessel-noun-lex &
  		[ STEM < "*pito-tsi" >,
- Specify gender for animal-noun-lex to remove ambiguity in animal subject MMT output.
	animals-noun-lex := noun-lex & noun-pc-alien-poss-rule-dtr & noun-pc-poss-rule-dtr &
	  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG [ PER 3rd,
	                                       GEND m ] ].

--------------------------------
Word order cleanup (removing parse and generator ambiguity for word order):
- Remove comp-head, subj-head, comp-head-2
	rules.tdl: ---------------
		; comp-head := comp-head-phrase.
		; subj-head := subj-head-phrase.
		; comp-head-2 := comp-head-phrase-2.
- Force all SUBJ-fulfilling rules to fire before COMPS-fulfilling rules (so that VSO is enabled but VOS is disallowed) by having all COMPS related rules require [ SUBJ < > ].
	+ Replace basic-head-opt-subj-phrase (head daughter of optional subj phrase has COMPS requirement already fulfilled) with basic-head-opt-comp-phrase (head daughter of optional comp phrase has SUBJ requirement already fulfilled)
	+ Add requirement to head-comp-phrase for head daughter SUBJ to be empty.
	+ Remove requirement to extracted-subj-phrase for head daughter COMPS to be empty and add requirement to extracted-comp-phrase for head daughter SUBJ to be empty to allow embedded question phrases like "who asked what the dogs chase" to also parse correctly.

	mcb.tdl: ---------------
		; basic-head-opt-subj-phrase :+ [ HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.COMPS < > ].
		basic-head-opt-comp-phrase :+ [ HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.SUBJ < > ].
		head-comp-phrase := basic-head-1st-comp-phrase & head-initial-head-nexus &
		  [ HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD.INIT +,
		                                VAL.SUBJ < >].	
		extracted-comp-phrase := basic-extracted-comp-phrase &
		  [ HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.SUBJ < > ].
		;  [ HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.SUBJ cons ].
		extracted-subj-phrase := basic-extracted-subj-phrase &
		  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD verb ].
		;  [ HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.COMPS < >,
		;    SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD verb ].

--------------------------------
Noun pc cleanup (removing parse and generator ambiguity for noun-pc combinatorial possibilities):
- Noun pcs weren't consistently firing, so we reorganized them to fire in the correct order by hooking up the correct dtr inheritance (thereby also addressing Emily's comment last week: "But the affixes attach one at a time, so your morphology has to be set up so that the prefixes attach after the suffixes (and some prefix PC takes a suffix PC as its daughter) or vice versa. If they both attach to the root, you never get both in the same word.")
	[ no tdl attached because we touched most noun-pc classes, but basically we reorganized the dtr supertypes ]

--------------------------------
Coordination cleanup (removing parse ambiguity for NP coordination, improving accuracy of behavior for S coordination):
- Remove np6 coordination rules for asyndetic coordination on NPs
	rules.tdl: ---------------
		; np6-top-coord := np6-top-coord-rule.
		; np6-bottom-coord := np6-bottom-coord-rule.
	mcb.tdl: ---------------
		; 	np6-top-coord-rule := basic-np-top-coord-rule & apoly-top-coord-rule &
		; 	  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.COORD-STRAT "6" ].
		; 	np6-bottom-coord-rule := unary-bottom-coord-rule & np-bottom-coord-phrase &
		; 	  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ COORD-STRAT "6",
		; 	                   COORD-REL.PRED "_and_coord_rel" ] ].
- Add S coordinating strategy for coordination with different SUBJ NPs. Previously, a sentence like "dogs chase cars and cats chase dogs" did not parse because the asyndetic VP coordination rule was looking for VPs as its daughters.
	(previously, this sentence parsed: <FIXTHIS>
		i-ogia-i *pito-tsi i-og-i matsontsori osheto
		dogs chase cars and eat cats
	 while this sentence did not:
	 	i-ogia-i osheto *pito-tsi , i-ogia-i matsontsori osheto
	 	dogs chase cars and cats chase dogs)

	mcb.tdl: ---------------
		;;; S Coordination Strategy 1
		s1-top-coord-rule := basic-s-top-coord-rule & apoly-top-coord-rule &
		  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.COORD-STRAT "1" ].
		s1-bottom-coord-rule := unary-bottom-coord-rule & s-bottom-coord-phrase &
		  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ COORD-STRAT "1",
		                   COORD-REL.PRED "_and_coord_rel" ] ].
	rules.tdl: ---------------
		s1-top-coord := s1-top-coord-rule.
		s1-bottom-coord := s1-bottom-coord-rule.

--------------------------------
Possessives cleanup (removing generator ambiguity of poss prefixes by constraining person/gender):
- Fix possessives to specify correct PER and GEND, which were previously underspecified, by making subclasses of noun-pc-poss-lex-rule.
	mcb.tdl: ---------------
		noun-pc-poss3m-lex-rule := noun-pc-poss-lex-rule &
		  [ C-CONT.RELS.LIST.FIRST.ARG0.PNG [ PER 3rd,
		                                      GEND m] ].
		noun-pc-poss3f-lex-rule := noun-pc-poss-lex-rule &
		  [ C-CONT.RELS.LIST.FIRST.ARG0.PNG [ PER 3rd,
		                                      GEND f] ].
		noun-pc-poss1-lex-rule := noun-pc-poss-lex-rule &
		  [ C-CONT.RELS.LIST.FIRST.ARG0.PNG [ PER 1st] ].
		noun-pc-poss2-lex-rule := noun-pc-poss-lex-rule &
		  [ C-CONT.RELS.LIST.FIRST.ARG0.PNG [ PER 2nd] ].
	irules.tdl: ---------------
		noun-pc-poss3m-prefix :=
		%prefix (* i-)
		noun-pc-poss3m-lex-rule.
		noun-pc-poss3f-prefix :=
		%prefix (* o-)
		noun-pc-poss3f-lex-rule.
		noun-pc-poss1-prefix :=
		%prefix (* no-)
		noun-pc-poss1-lex-rule.
		noun-pc-poss2-prefix :=
		%prefix (* pi-)
		noun-pc-poss2-lex-rule.

--------------------------------
Nonlocative suffix cleanup (removing generator ambiguity on locative suffix attaching to all nouns):
- Constrain intranstive and transitive verb class to have [CASE nlc] (non-locative) subject and complement to reduce MMT ambiguity. The copula PP is type aux-lex and will not inherit this change, allowing it to still take the nlc PP.
	mcb.tdl: ---------------
		transitive-verb-lex-super := main-verb-lex & transitive-lex-item &
		  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.COMPS < #comps >,
		    ARG-ST < [ LOCAL.CAT.HEAD noun &
		                              [ CASE nlc ] ],
		             #comps &
		             [ LOCAL.CAT cat-sat &
		                         [ VAL [ SPR < >,
		                                 COMPS < > ],
		                           HEAD noun &
		                                [ CASE nlc ] ] ] > ].
		intransitive-verb-lex := main-verb-lex & intransitive-lex-item &
		  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.COMPS < >,
		    ARG-ST < [ LOCAL.CAT.HEAD noun &
		               [ CASE nlc ] ] >,
		    INFLECTED [ VERB-PC-REALISIRREALIS-SUFFIX-FLAG -,
		                VERB-PC-ASPECT-FLAG - ] ].

Section 4: Description of the status of each MMT item.

MMT sentence semantics:
1) eng: Works (4 results)
   sje: (same)
2) eng: Works (8 results)
   sje: (same)
3) eng: Does not work, MRS is different ("pron_rel" is unknown because mcb does not use overt pronouns for "I chase you" so there is no relation for "I" and "you")
   sje: (same)
4) eng: Works (40 results)
   sje: Works (64 results)
5) Does not work, MCB not yet parsing due to negation not being implemented
6) eng: Does not work, MRS is different ("pron_rel" is unknown)
   sje: (same)
7) eng: Does not work, MRS is different ("pron_rel" is unknown)
   sje: Does not work, sje has this sentence SKIPPED
8) eng: Works (160 results)
   sje: Works (96 results)
   	*NOTE: A lot of ambiguity here is because our coordinating word "-ntiri" is inflected for the gender of the NP to its right, but we have not implemented gender agreement on this yet, so both coordinating words are generating, as well as both subject markers on the verb (since the coordinated NP has underspecified gender after coordination)
9) eng: Works (64 results)
   sje: (same)
    *NOTE: A lot of ambiguity here is because MCB verbs take an object marker if the object is definite but not if it is indefinite, and we haven't implemented anything to constrain the definite-ness of the nouns
10) eng: Does not work, unknown reason "transfer did 0 successful unifies and 0 failed ones"
   	sje: Works (96 results)
	 *SIDE NOTE: We checked the MRS and it seems correct, except that in MCB the sentence "cats chase dogs and sleep" would require anaphora resolution between the subject of chase and the subject of sleep, so "sleep" currently just has an unspecific 3rd-per masculine subject.
11) eng: Works (8 results), but the output generations are not correct
   	sje: (same)
   	 *NOTE: We believe that in MCB the polar questions require the topic NP in a post-verbal position and the other argument NP needs to be pre-verbal. For this sentence, our "correct" generation should be "matsontsori i-ogia-i=ri osheto ?" but our generations are variants on "ogia-i matsontsori osheto". The polar questions in Mcb are generally distinguished by intonation; we are not sure what in Eng/Sje would signal to the Mcb generator to treat the sentence as a polar question with this word order change.
12) Does not work, MCB not yet parsing due to non-copular APs not being implemented
13) eng: Does not work, MRS is different ("_in_p_rel" in Eng is "_loc_p_rel" in Mcb)
   	sje: Does not work, sje has this sentence SKIPPED
14) eng: Does not work, MRS is different ("_in_p_rel" in Eng is "_loc_p_rel" in Mcb)
   	sje: Does not work, sje has this sentence SKIPPED
15) eng: Works (4 results)
   	sje: Does not work, sje has this sentence SKIPPED
16) eng: Does not work, MRS is different ("_in_p_rel" in Eng is "_loc_p_rel" in Mcb)
   	sje: Does not work, sje has this sentence SKIPPED
17) eng: Works (4 results)
   	sje: Does not work, sje has this sentence SKIPPED
18) eng: Does not work, MCB not yet parsing (we are not really sure how to translate this sentence either) because we don't have non-pronomial possession implemented
	sje: (same)
19) eng: Works (8 results)
	sje: (same)
20) eng: Does not work, MRS is different ("_wh_q_rel" in Eng is "_which_q_rel" in Mcb, and it is also complaining about "_person_n_rel" but that looks the same in Mcb so we don't understand why that one is not mapping)
	sje: (same)
21) eng: Does not work, MRS is different ("_wh_q_rel" in Eng is "_which_q_rel" in Mcb, and it is also complaining about "_thing_n_rel" but that looks the same in Mcb so we don't understand why that one is not mapping)
	sje: (same)
22) eng: Does not work, MRS is different (same as #21, plus "pron_rel" is unknown)
	sje: (same)
23) eng: Does not work, MRS is different (same as combination of all of the issues in #20-22)
	sje: (same)
24) eng: Does not work, MRS is different (same as combination of all of the issues in #20-22)
	sje: (same)
25) eng: Does not work, MRS is different ("_because_subord_rel" needs to be implemented in Mcb - we should be able to do this next week, just didn't get to it when we did clausal modifiers)
	sje: Does not work, sje has this sentence SKIPPED
25) eng: Does not work, MRS is different ("_after_subord_rel" is not specified in Mcb - this is generally underspecified in Mcb as clausal combinations often leave temporal succession to be determined from context)
	sje: Does not work, sje has this sentence SKIPPED
