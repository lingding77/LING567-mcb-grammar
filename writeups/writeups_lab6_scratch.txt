ace MT output notes:

Sources of spurious ambiguity in MMT output:
- Main sources of ambiguity seem to come from possessives, which are attaching to "dogs sleep" because the features marking the poss_rel is not set up on the mcb side (we are working on fixing our adnominal possession)
	no- = 'my'
	pi- = 'your'
	i- = 'his'
	o- = 'her'
- Another main source of ambiguity comes from multiple realis suffixes not being differentiated (not sure what to do about this, see previous canvas question)
	-i 			REALIS
	-a 			REALIS.REFL
	-agani	 	PAS.REAL1
	-inkani 	PAS.REAL2
- Passive（per discussion on canvas, it seems we should remove these)
	-agani = PAS.REAL1
- "sing" relation being marked as both an auxiliary and a noun (these are wrong and should both be removed)
	matik = 'sing'
- alien noun suffix being attached to "dogs", which should be non-alien (we would like to fix this with some noun class cleanup)
	-tsi = ALIEN


While we were doing some investigation of possessive markers showing up spuriously in our translation of "dogs sleep," we poked around in english.tdl and mcb.tdl. Just wanted to double check with you that our understanding of what is happening is correct.

- English has possessive markers as determiners, so there is a lexical class poss-pron-det-lex for those that are marking the possessive semantic relation. Mcb has everything as morphology and (had we not stripped ours out because it wasn't working) marks the possessive semantic relation inside of noun pcs lex rules themselves. However, ultimately in the translation, it's looking to map the PRED "poss_rel" MRS feature between the two languages?

- We opened up the English grammar and looked at the MRS for "dogs sleep" and noticed that it has no "poss_rel," which makes sense because it's not possessive. But should we assume that once we get our adnominal possession working correctly that the presence of our morph prefixes will create a "poss_rel" that will be incompatible with the lack thereof in the English sentence? Aka, the absence of the feature in English is fully specified, not underspecified, correct?




Also, if this is the case, how do we convey what we talked about in class where the concept of English future is most closely mapped to tense imperfective + mood irrealis in MCB?

We are getting both our irr and real suffixes attaching to "dogs sleep" and it looks like the English is underspecified for both aspect and mood (marked only as tense=present). MCB doesn't really have tense, so doesn't this mean that every sentence is basically going to be mapped as every combination of aspect+mood?

So I noticed in the outputs that our verb sleep was combining with all mood=realis and not the mood=irrealis suffixes, and now I'm confused. How does it know that "dogs sleep" in English is mood=realis? The MRS only shows INDEX.MOOD=mood

%%%%% MORPHO SECTION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

- remove all auxiliaries?
- remove nouns that are actually NOMZ verbs

%%%%% PHENOMENON SECTION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Our "additional" phenomenon that we would like to tackle this week is clausal complements. There seem to be several verbs in our corpus that qualify as taking clausal complements, which are listed below (verbs that were noted in our Nanti grammar text are listed under perception/cognition/phasal, and others are listed at the bottom), along with any behaviors that were mentioned in the text:

General properties are:
- all complements are post-verbal, usually replacing object NPs
- only main clause can be negated (exception: verbs that take direct speech complements)
- require coreferential subjects in both main and complement clauses
	+ exception: verbs of communication, cognition, perception
- * This was not in the text, but the behavior observed in the corpus seems to suggest that aspect of the main and complement clauses can take on many different combinations, including PERF-PERF, (no aspect)-PERF, (no aspect)-(no aspect), and PERF-(no aspect). However, it's possible the verbs of perception may disallow PERF-(no aspect), based on the corpus data.

Verbs of perception:
	reality status of complement clause matches main clause
	complement clause sometimes (rarely) marked with subordinate clause clitic =ra
- see
- hear
- know
Verbs of cognition:
- think
Phasal verbs:
	reality status of complement clause matches main clause
	subject of main clause and complement clause necessarily coreferential
- begin
- finish
- remain
Other:
- want
	subject of main clause and complement clause necessarily coreferential
	complement clause must be irrealis-marked (regardless of reality status of main clause)
- feel
- go
- teach
- prepare

Due to the erratic use of the =ra subordinating clause clitic, the signal that a clause is in fact a complement clause seems to rely solely its position following a complement-clause-taking verb. The main clause verb can take an object marker, which seems to agree in gender and person with the subject of the complement clause, but that object marker is also not consistently used, so we're not 100% sure about this.

Question: Should we be "nominalizing" these complement clauses even if there is no nominalization marker? We do have a NOMZ nominalization marker, but those seem to be nominalizing single verbs into single nouns, not clauses.
