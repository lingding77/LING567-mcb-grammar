The first phenomena we pick this week is adnominal possession. It is interesting to see that there are two possessive patterns for Matsigenka. Basically, Matsigenka nouns can be split into two categories, the alienable nouns and inalienable nouns. Inalienable nouns stand for words like kin terms, body parts and a small amount of manufactured objects, while alienable nouns are things like commodities. 
Inalienable nouns have to appear with possessive prefixes as a noun phrase, like ‘my nose’ and ‘her brother.’ For alienable nouns, the possession is marked by three different suffixes distinguished by the prosodic factors. 
	disyllabic nominal roots take -ne,
	trisyllabic or larger roots take -te,
	some specific manufactured object nouns take -re.
Therefore, we created 5 pairs of sentences that can test the grammar. The negative sentences have problems like missing the possessive prefix, missing the possessive suffix, adding an extra alienable possessive suffix to an inalienable noun, and using wrong possessive suffix. 

The following is a pair of example sentences for adnominal possession.

The second phenomena we pick is wh-questions:
Wh-questions in Matsigenka is similar to the interrogation patterns in English. The interrogation pronoun is put in the sentence initial position. The common interrogate gloss is presented below.
interrogative         gloss
tata                      `what'
tsini                `who, whom'
tyani        `which one (animate)'
tyati        `which one (inanimate)'
tya(ra)             `where', `how'
While the subject or the object is the questioning target, we usually omit the subject/object marker. To test this feature, we created 4 sentences that are related to the word ‘who.’ However, we cannot find an interrogative ‘who’ in our corpus. Therefore, examples 11 to 14 are sort of useless at some point. 
When a peripheral argument (neither object nor subject) is being interrogated, neither subject marker nor object marker would be omitted. 
Also, the word ‘why’ in Matsigenka cannot be presented as a single word, but a word ‘where/how’ plus a light verb ‘happen’.
